# Airbnb Reviews App Clone

> I built this project from scratch to clone an Airbnb product page "Reviews" module. It generates persisting averages, user, and reviews data that can be viewed via the endpoint PORT/rooms/:id (for id values 0-99). Made with full-stack js using MySQL, Express, React, and Node.
